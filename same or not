He asked her a question to check her knowledge of Arrays. Can you help Cinderella to write a program to find whether the two arrays are the same or not?
Note: Two arrays are said to be the same if the sum of both arrays is the same and the size of the arrays is the same.

Input Format
Input consists of 2 integers and 2 arrays. The integers should correspond to the size of the arrays.

      sum2=0
      for i in a1:
        sum1+=i
      for j in a2:
        sum2+=j
      if sum1==sum2:
            print("Same")
      else:
            print("Not Same")
    else:
      print("Not Same")
n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
a1=[int(input()) for i in range(n1)]
a2=[int(input()) for j in range(n2)]
array_format(n1,n2,a1,a2)
