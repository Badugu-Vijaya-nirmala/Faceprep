Dolores Abarnathy and Maeve Millay were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. 
Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.

Input Format:
Input consists of n+1 integers. 
The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 
The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 
Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:
Refer to sample output for details.

Sample Input:
5
2
3
6
8
-1

Sample Output:
The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2

program:
n=int(int(input()))
a=[int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
if n<=15:
  sum1=0
  sum2=0
  for i in a:
    if i%2==0:
      sum1+=i
    else:
      sum2+=i
  print(f'The sum of the even numbers in the array is {sum1}')
  print(f'The sum of the odd numbers in the array is {sum2}')
